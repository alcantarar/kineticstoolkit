def find_recovery_indices(Mz):

    Find recovery indices based on a vector of propulsion moments.

    This function analyzes the Mz moments to find which data correspond to
    pushes and which data correspond to recoveries. The method is very
    conservative on what could be considered as a recovery, so that every
    index returned by this function is almost certain to correspond to a
    recovery. This function is used by pushrimkinetics.remove_sinusoids
    to identify the instants with no hand contact. It should not be used to
    isolate the push and recovery phases (use pushrimkinetics.detectpushes
    instead).

    Parameters
    ----------
    Mz : array
        Array that contains the propulsion moments in Nm.

    Returns
    -------
    index : array
        Array of bools where each True represents recovery.

        TimeSeries that contains at least Forces, Moments and Angle data.
    baseline_kinetics : TimeSeries, optional

        pushed by an operator and where no external force must be applied on
