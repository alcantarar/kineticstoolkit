Public version
--------------

The public open-source version API is mostly stable (although currently almost
empty). I do not expect to remove or rename much stuff. However please keep
in mind that this is experimental software. If you are using ktk or are
planning to be, you are warmly invited to contact me, first to say Hello :-),
and so that I can warn you before doing major, possibly breaking changes.

Private unstable version
------------------------

This version is exclusively used in my lab and is developed in parallel with
my research projects, following the needs of the moment. I usually wait several
months before releasing code to the public, mostly to ensure the modules are
stable and the API is mature and global enough to be shared. If you are
interested in collaborating either in research or software development, please
contact me at chenier.felix@uqam.ca
