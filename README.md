Kinetics Toolkit
================

Kinetics Toolkit (ktk) is an in-house biomechanical library developed by
Professor Félix Chénier at Université du Québec à Montréal.

There are two versions of ktk: a private version that is exclusively used in
my lab, and a public version that is distributed on PyPI. I usually wait
several months before releasing to the public, to ensure the modules are
stable and mature enough to be shared.

If you are interesting in collaborating either in research or software
development, please contact me at chenier.felix@uqam.ca
