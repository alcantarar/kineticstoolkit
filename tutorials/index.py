KTK Tutorials (Python experimental version)
===========================================
Kinetics Toolkit (KTK) is an in-house biomechanical library developed by
Professor Félix Chénier at Université du Québec à Montréal. Originally
programmed in and for Matlab, KTK is quickly becoming a collection of Python
modules that aim to manage experimental files using a database and process
3d kinetics, 3d kinematics and EMG data.

Although KTK is developed primarily for my laboratory, it will be my great
pleasure to initiate collaborations and use this library to share expertise
and data with other researchers. Please feel free to communicate with me to
discuss about such collaborations:
