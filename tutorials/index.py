KTK Tutorials (Python experimental version)
===========================================
Kinetics Toolkit (KTK) is an in-house biomechanical library developed by
Professor Félix Chénier at Université du Québec à Montréal. Originally
programmed in and for Matlab, KTK is quickly becoming a collection of Python
modules that aim to manage experimental files using a database and process
3d kinetics, 3d kinematics and EMG data.

Although KTK is developed primarily for my laboratory, it will be my great
pleasure to initiate collaborations and use this library to share expertise
and data with other researchers. Please feel free to communicate with me to
discuss about such collaborations:

TimeSeries
----------
The TimeSeries is an object provided by KTK to represent data that varies in
time.

[Go to the TimeSeries tutorial](timeseries.html)

pushrimkinetics
---------------
Module that processes kinetics data from instrumented wheelchair wheels.

[Go to the pushrimkinetics tutorial](pushrimkinetics.html)

geometry
--------
Module that allows the creation of reference frames and simplifies passing
coordinates from local to global reference frames and vice-versa.

[Go to the geometry tutorial](geometry.html)

inversedynamics
---------------
Module that calculates the proximal forces and moments based on an inverse
dynamics algorithm.

[Go to the inversedynamics tutorial](inversedynamics.html)

dbinterface
-----------
Module that communicates with Félix Chénier's biomechanics database to import
all non-personal information from a given project.
