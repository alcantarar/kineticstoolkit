Kinetics toolkit tutorials
==========================
Kinetics Toolkit (ktk) is an in-house biomechanical library developed by
Professor Félix Chénier at Université du Québec à Montréal. Originally
programmed in and for Matlab, ktk is quickly becoming a collection of Python
modules that aim to manage experimental files using a database and process
3d kinetics, 3d kinematics and EMG data.

Although ktk is developed primarily for my laboratory, it is my plan to
opensource it someday, when it is more polished and complete. In the mean
time, it will be my great pleasure to initiate collaborations and use this
library to share expertise and data with other researchers. Please feel free
to communicate with me to discuss about such collaborations:
